# u1-motion-tweaks

A co-repo of Bespok3d plugins for the Snapmaker U1 that publishes its own sub-list.

Plugins:

- **klipper-motion** - Cleaner surfaces and quieter moves, from the latest Klipper motion code.
- **tmc-autotune** - Argolein's optimized TMC2240 driver parameters for X/Y.
- **tmc-low-current** - Cooler, quieter X/Y motion at reduced stepper current.

## Layout

```text
u1-motion-tweaks/
  <plugin-id>/          # one plugin = one dir; its name is the manifest .name
    manifest.json
    files/              # payload the daemon places on the printer
    doc/README.md       # rendered in-app; not deployed
  .github/workflows/release.yml
  index.json            # the published sub-list (committed; referenced by main-index lists[])
  dist/                 # build output (gitignored)
```

Each plugin declares WHAT (a destination `class` + a `restart` hook), never a path or a raw
command; the printer-side adapter realizes it. See `Bespok3d_history/doc/anatomy-of-a-plugin.md`.

## Build locally

Needs Node.js 20+. Builds run through the shared `Bespok3d/b3-builder` tool:

```sh
npm install github:Bespok3d/b3-builder
npx b3-builder build --source ./klipper-motion --atom-repo Bespok3d/u1-motion-teweaks
# -> dist/klipper-motion-<ver>.b3 + dist/klipper-motion.atom.json
```

Drop `--source` to build every plugin in the repo at once.

## Releasing

Bump a plugin's `manifest.json` `version` and push to `main`. CI runs the `Bespok3d/b3-builder`
Action over the whole repo, which packs each `.b3`, cuts a release per plugin, assembles this repo's
`index.json` sub-list as `U1 Motion Tweaks`, and registers it in `Bespok3d/main-index`
(`lists/<repo>.json`). Secret: `MAIN_INDEX_TOKEN` (contents:write on main-index). Signing deferred.

## Maintainership

These plugins are published and maintained by the Bespok3d org, and several of them repackage or
build on upstream source material. If you own the source material a plugin is based on and would
rather manage it yourself, you are welcome to contact the org to claim it back. The one condition is
that it stays actively maintained: a claimed plugin left to rot will be reclaimed so users are never
stranded on an abandoned package.
